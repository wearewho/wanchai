            <h3 class="text-center">Providing house and offices cleaning services for more nhan 10 years</h3>
            <p class="text-center">The Cleaning Company is widely recognized for our commitment to serving our customers while staying friendly to the environment. We have a history of excellence and dedication to our clients, providing professional and high-quality house cleaning services across America.</p>
            <p class="info">Franchising began in 1996 and has grown to include more than 215 locations across North America.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    Our company was founded in the Baltimore- Washington metro area in 1987 as one of the first whole house cleaning services in the region. In 1989, Martin Greg and John Rambo purchased the company and broadened its scope to serve even more clients.

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    This quality commitment and reputation for excellent service attracted outside investors. In 2014, the company announced a majority acquisition by PNC Riverarch Capital. This exciting change didn't mean a complete overhaul:

                    The management team did not change and Steve continued on in his leadership position with the Board of Directors. We are excited to announce a new era of growth for both new and existing units under the guidance of PNC.
